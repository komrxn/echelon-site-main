/*
 * The shift, as a list — one definition, used by the header panel and by the
 * footer sitemap, because two copies of a navigation list are two lists that
 * drift.
 *
 * Not one new string. Every name is the section's own kicker, already written
 * and already proofread in all three locales, so the index cannot fall out of
 * step with the section it points at and nothing had to be invented in a
 * language nobody here writes. Two entries are not kickers because they could
 * not be: `hero` has none, and `night`'s reads "23:00", which beside the hour
 * the row already carries would say the same thing twice.
 *
 * Hours are deliberately not here. They live on the sections as `data-shift` —
 * the same value the ambient light and the header clock run on — and are read
 * off the document at runtime. A second copy typed into a list is a copy that
 * can be wrong, and this page has already spent one phase unpicking a clock
 * that disagreed with itself.
